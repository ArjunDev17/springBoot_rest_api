Problem:
Consider two beans of the same type:


@Component
public class BeanA implements MyInterface {
    // BeanA implementation
}

@Component
public class BeanB implements MyInterface {
    // BeanB implementation
}
Now, in a service class, you want to autowire a bean of type MyInterface, but there's ambiguity:

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyInterface myBean; // Ambiguity: Which bean to inject?

    // rest of the service code
}
Solution using @Qualifier:
Annotate Beans with Qualifiers:

@Component
@Qualifier("beanA")
public class BeanA implements MyInterface {
    // BeanA implementation
}

@Component
@Qualifier("beanB")
public class BeanB implements MyInterface {
    // BeanB implementation
}
Use @Qualifier in Autowiring:

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("beanA")
    private MyInterface myBean;

    // rest of the service code
}
How it Identifies the Qualifier "beanA":
When you annotate a bean with @Qualifier("beanA"), you are providing a specific identifier (the qualifier) for that bean. In the example above, BeanA is annotated with @Qualifier("beanA").

When you use @Autowired along with @Qualifier("beanA") in the MyService class, you are telling Spring to inject the bean with the specified qualifier. In this case, it's asking Spring to inject the bean identified by "beanA" (BeanA).

By explicitly specifying the qualifier, you are resolving the ambiguity issue, and Spring knows exactly which bean to inject into the myBean variable in MyService.
